# Welcome to fman's issue tracker!

You can use it to request features and file bugs, but also for general discussion (if you like).

Issues are prioritised by the number of votes they receive. You can vote on issues using [GitHub's Reactions feature](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments).

This page is still in an early stage. Feedback is highly appreciated! If you have ideas or suggestions for improvements, please [share them](https://github.com/fman-community/fman/issues/new).
