# Welcome to fman's community!

This page hosts fman's [issue tracker](https://github.com/fman-community/fman/issues). You can use it to request features and file bugs, but also for general discussion.

Issues are prioritised by the number of votes they receive. You can vote on issues using [GitHub's Reactions feature](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments).

This page is still in an early stage. If you have ideas or suggestion for improvements, please [share them](https://github.com/fman-community/fman/issues/new).
